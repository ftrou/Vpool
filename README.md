# Efficient Inference Offload with Vpool

This repository demonstrates an optimized inference pipeline for running **large language models** (LLMs) on **consumer-grade GPUs**—like the RTX 4070 Super with 12 GB VRAM—using advanced **offloading techniques** and **mixed precision inference**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Device Offloading**  
  Automatically assigns only essential parts of the model to your GPU using `device_map="auto"`, reducing memory pressure.

- **Mixed Precision Inference**  
  Uses `torch.cuda.amp.autocast()` to lower memory use and speed up inference with minimal accuracy tradeoff.

- **Performance Monitoring**  
  Tracks GPU VRAM and system RAM usage for transparency and debugging.

## 🧠 Why It Matters
This system proves that even the largest models (e.g. 405B parameters) can be run on commodity hardware through efficient memory allocation and precision strategies.

If you thought LLaMA 405B required 8x H100s, think again.

## 🛠️ Coming Soon: Vpool Pro SDK
We're working on an advanced version of Vpool for developers and teams who want to:
- Optimize offloading strategies with pre-tuned profiles
- Monitor GPU/CPU memory usage in real time
- Run massive models on smaller hardware without cluster setup
- Bundle Vpool into agent platforms or edge deployments

Interested in early access or commercial support?
